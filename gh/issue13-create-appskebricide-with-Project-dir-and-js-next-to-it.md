- TODO Create a folder at `apps/kebricide` for [[GitHub/codekiln/kebricide]]
	- TODO folder should have same rough structure as `apps/maxmsp-test`, but instead of putting typescript in `Code`, typescript will mirror the directory structure of [[GitHub/zsteinkamp/m4l-typescript-base]], with a structure roughly like:
		-
		  ```
		  Project/Device.amxd
		  Project/Project.maxproj
		  Project/index.js
		  Project/utils.js
		  ```
