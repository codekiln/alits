# Use the GitHub CLI to create a Merge Request
- Use [current-task.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc) to find the current task.
- The [mr-description.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mr-description.mdc) for the current task should already be created in `gh/issue<IssueNum>-MR-<IssueDescription>.md`
- use `gh pr create --title "Your PR title" --body-file path/to/your/description.md`
  - here `Your PR title` should be the title of the issue as inferred from the issue description
  - the body file should be the current task's Merge Request description file
