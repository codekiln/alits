# Create a Merge Request Description
- primary job: create a GitHub Merge Request description which should close the current task
- Use [current-task.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/current-task.mdc) or the supplied task context file to find the current GitHub issue being worked on. 
  - it will be describe in a markdown file in the `gh/*` directory named after the issue
    - for example, `gh/issue22-<IssueDescription>.md` (note `issue22` is not the current task, this is just an example)
- Create a markdown file next to the current task's file in the `gh/` directory, name it after the current task file but with a `-MR-` in the middle of the filename for Merge Request
  - name it according to the schema `gh/issue<IssueNum>-MR-<IssueDescription>.md`, where `IssueNum` and `IssueDescription` are the same as the current issue  
- Following [markdown-output.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/markdown-output.mdc), and using the diff with the main branch, put a merge request description in that will close the github issue
