- [ ] Add "rename" command for renaming project and folder
- [ ] Find a way to auto-sanitize Max Project file structure
- [ ] Add a function to create patcher files from JSON, possibly "ui" or "main"
- [ ] Experiment with [maxpy](https://github.com/Barnard-PL-Labs/MaxPy) to build max patches programmatically
- [ ] Experiment with [are-you-es5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/are-you-es5) to check dependencies compatibility
- [ ] Experiment with [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile dependencies
