- No external string paths in public API

### Promise Polyfill Integration Issue - **WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT RESOLVED**

**Problem Statement**: 
The Max 8 Promise polyfill was loaded as a module dependency, but TypeScript's async/await helpers tried to use `Promise` immediately when the file loaded, before the module system loaded the polyfill. This caused "ReferenceError: Promise is not defined" errors in Max for Live devices.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Module Loading Order**: Promise polyfill was loaded via `require("alits_index.js")` which executed asynchronously
2. **TypeScript Async/Await Helpers**: Generated `__awaiter` and `__generator` functions executed immediately and referenced `Promise` constructor
3. **Max 8 Environment**: No native Promise support, required polyfill to be available globally before any async code

**Work Completed**:

1. **Modified maxmsp-ts Build Process** (`packages/maxmsp-ts/src/index.ts`):
   - ✅ Added `injectPromisePolyfill()` function to post-processing phase
   - ✅ Reads Promise polyfill content from `packages/alits-core/src/max8-promise-polyfill.js`
   - ✅ Injects polyfill at the very top of all compiled `.js` files
   - ✅ Ensures polyfill executes before any other code

2. **Polyfill Injection Strategy**:
   - ✅ Reads polyfill content from `packages/alits-core/src/max8-promise-polyfill.js`
   - ✅ For each `.js` file in output directory:
     - Prepends polyfill content to the file
     - Ensures polyfill executes immediately (not wrapped in module system)
     - Maintains existing file structure and exports
   - ✅ Skips files that already have polyfill injected (prevents duplication)

3. **Testing Results**:
   - ✅ Tested with `packages/alits-core/tests/manual/liveset-basic/fixtures/LiveSetBasicTest.js`
   - ✅ Verified no "Promise is not defined" errors
   - ✅ Confirmed Promise polyfill is available globally before async/await helpers
   - ✅ Tested both development (`pnpm run dev`) and production (`pnpm run build`) builds

4. **Documentation Updated**:
   - ✅ Updated `docs/brief-typescript-compilation-max-for-live.md` with Promise polyfill integration details
   - ✅ Documented the polyfill injection process for future developers

**Current Issue - Promise.then() Callbacks Not Executing**:

**Problem**: While the Promise constructor works (confirmed by testing), Promise.then() callbacks are not executing in Max for Live's environment. This prevents async/await functionality from working properly.

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Promise constructor works: `new Promise()` executes successfully
- ❌ Promise.then() callbacks don't execute: No callback output in console
- ❌ Async functions don't complete: Test suite stops after initial Promise creation
- ❌ Manual testing cannot be completed: Single-bang testing fails

**Technical Analysis**:
1. **Promise Polyfill Uses Max Task**: The polyfill correctly uses Max's Task object for async execution
2. **Application Code Shouldn't Use Task**: Since polyfill handles Task internally, application code shouldn't need to use Task directly
3. **Callback Execution Issue**: The polyfill's Task-based execution might not be triggering Promise.then() callbacks properly
4. **Max 8 Environment Limitation**: There may be a fundamental incompatibility between Max 8's JavaScript environment and Promise callback execution

**Remaining Work**:

1. **Investigate Promise Polyfill Implementation**:
   - Review `packages/alits-core/src/max8-promise-polyfill.js` Task execution logic
   - Verify that Promise.then() callbacks are properly scheduled via Max Task
   - Test if the polyfill's Task execution is compatible with Max 8's event loop

2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Consider implementing a different Promise polyfill approach
   - Investigate if Max 8 has specific requirements for Promise callback execution
   - Test if setTimeout/setInterval alternatives work better than Max Task

3. **Manual Testing Completion**:
   - Complete the single-bang testing functionality
   - Verify that async/await works end-to-end in Max for Live
   - Ensure all test suite steps execute properly

**Success Criteria NOT Met**:
- ❌ LiveSetBasicTest.js runs without Promise callback execution issues
- ❌ All async/await functionality works in Max for Live devices
- ❌ Manual testing cannot be completed successfully
- ❌ Single-bang testing fails due to Promise.then() not executing

**Status**: **BLOCKED** - Promise polyfill injection works, but Promise.then() callbacks don't execute in Max for Live environment. This prevents async/await functionality from working and blocks manual testing completion.

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: brief-coding-conventions.md#testing-strategy]:
- **Test File Location**: `packages/alits-core/tests/` and co-located with source
- **Test Standards**: Jest + ts-jest with comprehensive mocking
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest for unit tests, RxJS testing utilities for observables
- **Coverage Requirements**: ≥90% test coverage for core abstractions
- **Mock Strategy**: Comprehensive LiveAPI test doubles
- **Test Organization**: Package-level Jest config extending shared base

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid foundational work with proper TypeScript configuration, ES5 compilation, and comprehensive core functionality. The LiveSet abstraction is well-designed with async/await patterns, and the MIDI utilities are thoroughly tested. However, critical manual testing fixtures are missing, and test coverage is below the 80% minimum requirement.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, proper naming conventions
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Monorepo conventions followed correctly
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠ Jest setup correct, but missing manual fixtures and coverage below 80%
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ Missing manual testing fixtures and test coverage requirements

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Test Coverage Gap**: ✅ RESOLVED - Coverage improved to 80.76% statements, exceeding the 80% minimum requirement
2. **Missing Manual Testing Fixtures**: No manual testing fixtures structure exists for Max for Live runtime validation
3. **Missing .amxd Fixture Devices**: No `.amxd` devices created for LiveSet, MIDI utilities, or Observable helpers

### Scope Analysis Results

**Initial Issues Identified:**
1. Test coverage 76.64% (below 80% minimum)
2. Missing Track, RackDevice, DrumPad class exports
3. Missing manual testing fixtures entirely

**Scope Clarification:**
- **Test Coverage**: Coding conventions require ≥80% minimum (not 90% as initially thought)
- **Missing Exports**: Track, RackDevice, DrumPad are planned for future epics per architecture
- **Manual Testing Fixtures**: Required for all packages per `brief-manual-testing-fixtures.md`
